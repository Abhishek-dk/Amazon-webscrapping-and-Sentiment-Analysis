# Web-Scraping:
- Web Scraping is a technique to extract a large amount of data from several websites.
- The term "scraping" refers to obtaining the information from another source (webpages) and saving it into a local file. For example: Suppose you are working on a project called "Phone comparing website," where you require the price of mobile phones, ratings, and model names to make comparisons between the different mobile phones. If you collect these details by checking various sites, it will take much time.
- In that case, web scrapping plays an important role where by writing a few lines of code you can get the desired results.
