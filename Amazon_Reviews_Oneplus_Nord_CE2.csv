0,4,One Plus Nord Ce2 Lite 5g,A Midrange phone from oneplus. why I choose this phone is only because of the brand value we have more other option like Vivo t1 / realme 9 /9 Pro / Oppo/ Motorola but the oneplus has their own premium feel the reason why I have given only four star.......1). The Amoled display is not there but it is not important.2) The wide angle lens is also not there.3) they have removed alert slider. Otherwise the phone is perfect I am satisfied with this device 95% you can definitely go for it. the important thing is that red cable is available which is a signature of oneplus mobile also the oxygen OS is perfect I like it and it's give extremely performance that fill you like a { Makhan Malai }.Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•,02 September 2022
1,4,NICE PHONE WITH NICE FEATURES BUT BATTERY & BRIGHTNESS SHOULD BE MORE BETTER,"I was searching a smartphone in 25-30k segment checked lot of phones but could not find a good phone with on screen FPS and dedicated sim/MC slot suddenly I checked on google that 1+ is also launching the phones with these features and then I watched an unboxing video and decided to buy this phone the brightness of the display and battery should be more good so it will be definitely more awesome but as per performance and brand of 1+ phone is good in 23000 (including cards discount) the antutu is about to 5lac when the antutu of iphone 12 (Rs 42k cost) is 6.25 lac so this deal is not bad, but if you are planing to buy so just check the phone at the showroom or on ytube.", 07 November 2022
2,4,Best for elderly people,"Bought in big billion day sale but towards the end. My experience is when Amazon takes time in delivering a product, it will be worth it because they push bad product line in starting and immediate delivery. Gifted my mother (58years), and for an elderly person, this phone is perfect.I was initially confused whether to buy this then went for it after reading reviews that its good for elderly person.I setup the phone before giving to my mother. And I am using oneplus6t constantly since may 2019. So oneplus nord ce 2 lite felt like a power in hand. Super fluid, battery, camera, features.Although I would not recommend this phone for youngsters, but its ok if you want a budget power filled smartphone.",08 November 2022
3,4,Good one,"*Battery life is decent, if you're a heavy user you'll get a backup of 12-15hrs after 100% charge.But as I'm not a heavy user I'm getting a backup of more than 24 hrs.*Camera is also good, night mode is working good if you have a good light, if not you'll not get satisfaction.*The main issue of this phone is brightness. If you're keeping your brightness level at the lowest then you won't be able to see things properly in the night also.And outdoor you have to keep the brightness high.Which will affect your battery backup.*TIll now I have faced only one issue, which is brightness. But rest all are working fine.",02 November 2022
4,4,After 6 months of use,"After the six months of use i would like to say it is a very good phone in this price range but within 6 month of use i am facing few problems like sometime many apps like Paytm, phonepe etc gets crashed as it is opened the contacts are not able to save as well as you cannot make calls sometimes as this app also gets crashing i have noticed this to OnePlus care also but they are clueless hope they'll soon give a update and able to fix this major problem as i don't want to do hard reset.",04 November 2022

8,4,Good phone for daily needs,Bought this phone for my Dad who wanted to chuck away his redmi note 7. He is not a gamer and wanted a phone that doesn't hung or pop some odd instructions during UPI or credit card payments or any transactions whatsoever.  Oxygen OS is light and very user friendly. No confusions at all unlike mini for the elderly., 5 November 2022

135,4,A decent package for non gamers and everything thing is decent not the best out there,"The media could not be loaded.
                



¬†Build quality - Rating 7.5 : One of the light weight phones out there and has to say it's quite comfortable for one hand usage and even the material used is polycarbonate but gets the job done but doesn't matter if back cover is there . In terms of styling it's similar to oppo phone but i liked it but won't recommend gray one as it attaches fingerprints but if you are going to use back cover then it doesn't matterDisplay -  Rating 8 : Really good amoled plan and 90hz refresh rate works well wish it could have been 120hz . But the bottom chin is quite thick that is the only thing and yes there is gorilla glass 5 protection and screen guard pre applied too . But the panel on this one is the not the best out there but it's pretty decent as wellPerformance - Rating 9 :Dimensity 900 with ufs 2.2 and lppdr4x Ram gets the job done for regular day to day operations and I didn't played games so can't say but considering this soc is pretty good you can expect 50 fps stable in bgmi and cod . Still I would say this processor is good but competition is offering better so you decide . For me gaming doesn't matter and for next 2 years it can last me easily for normal.usageSoftware- 8.5 : biggest con is Android 11 based on oxygen OS or should I say future color oos üòÇ but overall it's quite stable and no bugs as of now but still can't say a lot will have to wait for Android 12 to have better ideaCamera -  Rating 7.5 : 64mp is decent I was atleast expecting samsung sensor though but they provided omnivison sensor which gets the job done but to be Frank I am not into camera that much so better to check other reviews and video stability in 1080p is good and 8mp ultratwide is decent as well . Still the camera is not the best out there again I am saying this because others are offering better but OnePlus managed to give decent thingsBattery -  Rating 9: on 90hz refresh rate with 40 percent brightness and dark mode excluding gaming it gives 7 hrs of sot from 99 to 89 on wifi network and then 89 to 59 on jio network and rest remaining on wifi . So battery for normal tasks can last more than 1.5 day . Charging takes about 30 minutes to charge from 10 percent to 99 which is pretty fastSpeakers -  6: pathetic only single speaker and quality is moderate5g bands - 8 bands so it' is futuristicCall quality - Rating 10 :  it's amazing pretty loud and none of the parties ever complained about my voice that is getting mumbledSo to conclude you can buy this one if you only care for OnePlus and you want to try OnePlus for the first time . I was even getting mi 11 lite ne 5g at same price but rejected it due to miui . So for normal users and those who want a stable software without any ads or notification or bloatwares its good",  26 February 2022

¬†First time finger print reader not work but after that istam work well done",01 October 2022
383,2,Android Auto Doesn't Work || UPI Apps don't work on Roaming,"Bought it 19 August. Regretting since 20 August.Took me a while to figure out how to start Android Auto by default when plugged into a car (you have to manually enable Android Auto the first time). First time I plugged it in I was in a busy road and was unsure which way to go. The phone just wouldn't pick up Android Auto. I had to manually configure it later on after watching a couple of videos on YT. Since then, whenever I plug it in my car, I keep getting the pop-up that asks me to choose whether I want to ""Use USB to - Charge Only - or Transfer Files/Android Auto - or Transfer Photos"". No matter how many times I select Android Auto, the same thing keeps popping up, and Android Auto DOES NOT WORK. Never faced this problem with my old Redmi Note 5 Pro.When I was roaming outside my home circle (Kolkata) for a few weeks, the following apps didn't work: Zomato, PhonePe, Paytm. I had read before ordering the phone that they don't always optimize apps for non-Snapdragon processors. With its Mediatek Dimensity 900 ""monster of a chipset"", my phone itself turned into a monster and betrayed me when I needed it most. I couldn't order food, and GPay was my only savior for payment through QR code scanning. Only at my room with a wifi, these apps worked. Then when I came back to Kolkata again these apps started working fine.When I drive 550km to my hometown, there are long stretches when there is no network, yet on my previous phone, Android Auto would continue to work as the car/phone was probably following its GPS. I could rely on it. Since purchasing this phone, I don't have the confidence any more that Android Auto will even work in an area with full network, let alone in an area without any.When connected for even 5 minutes on USB to car, the phone heats up. More than once it simply hung up and stopped functioning. The fingerprint sensor often is not able to read the fingerprint.There are pros - the 65W charging is super fast; and the camera is reasonably good (if it weren't on a 25k phone, that would be another star taken away).Overall, I am dissatisfied and disillusioned with the phone. Better to buy a top model Maruti Swift with all features abnd accessories than a lowest model Hyundai Creta with zero features and accessories. For the 25k price range, it's better to go for a Redmi phone with top specs than the lowest end OnePlus phones. I don't know about other OnePlus models but this one is a disaster.Severely disappointed.",08 November 2022

You will capture more videos than expected.UI: Coming from MIUI. Its very easy for me to say Oxygen OS is amazing. No debate in thatBattery: Amazing, will change how you use your phone. 15 minute is enough for 4 hours of use. It gives so peace of mind, once you tried it you wont be able to live without it.FP sensor is okay not as snappy as side or rear one but still work fine. You wont notice it.Feel: Super Slippery buy a rugged case immediately. Amazing to look at like. But feels delicate.Price: for 22K its a steal. For original price add little more to get Nord 2T, Poco F4, Nothing phone(1) all these phone are affordable flagship.This phone is just a mid-range phone and should cost 22K for 25 you are better off with spending little more and get those above mentioned phones.",07 July 2022

408,4,This is good in terms of display. Camera is not as good as old phones.,"Previously, I used a Samsung Galaxy A8 Plus. This phone is nowhere near to it in terms of display and camera quality. I think the hardware of old phones were really good. This phone has a lesser pixel size on the camera sensor. Therefore it's hard to get quality shots at low light. These photos are shot in pro mode. Camere really disappointed me. The display is okay. Android 12 gives a nice UI. Vibration and haptics are horrible when compared to my old phone. The colors are also facing some issues.

449,3,Average Phone. So keep average expectations.,"Writing the reviews after 3 days of UsageDesign: Phone's design is good looking and decent. The phone sits well in the hands but has to be used with a cover due to its glossy finish at the back. The phone comes with a cover and the screen cover as well. There is one speaker besides the charging point and there's a 3.5mm jack as well. Volume buttons are to the left side and the front camera is placed at the top left corner of the phone.Performance: Good performance. I tried gaming on this phone with high specs and found no issues, no major lags found. Yeah the phone heats up a bit after continuous usage. Continuous calls will heat the phone as well. Heating issues reported on other OnePlus devices are still being noticed here in this phone but not to thay extent, seems that OnePlus has worked on it but not to a greater extent! Apps work smoothly as far as performance is concerned. Unlocking phone is quick. Android 12 could have made this phone a perfect buy, but that's not a deal breaker either as OnePlus has promised a guaranteed 2 year Phone updates and 3 years security updates.Battery: Okayish. If you're a gamer or heavy user like viewing lot of videos etc, you'll have to charge your phone twice a day. For a Average user this phone will get 1 day enough to survive. Battery drains are worked but again not to a great extent. But that is coped up with the 65W charger which as per my real time experiments charged from 0 to 80 in 25 mins not 15 mins claimed by OnePlus. Battey improvements must be done by OnePlus further.Camera: Decent, but not impressive. 64MP is what on the papers but realme sensors work good versus this Phone. Night photos are not sharp as well. Colors are thrown by the AI but still would like to have improvements on the camera perspective. Definitely not the OnePlus benchmark cams for sure.Music, Audio, Video, Display: The speakers are not dobly ones but do the job wonderfully. Enough sound and no issues with video calls. Watching videos and graphics are good, impressed here. Phone will give you two options of 60 hz and 90 hz display rates with 90 as default and this too does the job very well. Scrolling and switching between the apps works smooth.Overall its a decent phone. The issue stands with longetivity of the Mediatek Processor and OnePlus support to this phone. As per my views if you're a gamer, would suggest not to go with this phone. If you're a normal user and charging phone twice a day is not a concern for you, go for it. If you are user having expectations from camera performance, don't go with this phone.

451,5,"Best phone in 25 k segment, camera well adjusted, portrait mode is fabulous, battery good","Excellent phone best buy in 24 k 8 gb variant, camera well adjusted, portrait mode fabulous in low light also, processor good, battery back up 20 min whole day",  31 October 2022
452,5,A good choice for upgrade,"Nord CE 2 is a decent choice for someone looking to upgrade from an under 15k segment phone. Review after using the 6GB variant for 5 days:Pros:- Decent battery life and excellent charging speed- Smooth performance and display- Comparatively compact and light weight- ""Unofficial"" water resistance (read below)- Design and color is neatCons:- Speaker isn't great- Camera is okayish- Unsure of OS experience in the future, stable and bloat free as of nowDetailed:- Decent battery life and performance. I got around 7 to 8 hrs of screen time from battery at 100% to 20% with normal use with 4G internet (social media, chat, some camera and mobile hotspot tethering at 90HZ display refresh rate). Changing display refresh rate to 60Hz seems to improve battery drain, but 90Hz looks very smooth.- 65W fast charging is great, can charge from 20% to 100% in 30 minutes. Also not much heating during charging.- OS looks clean, some preinstalled apps could be uninstalled or disabled. But surprisingly found 3 file manager apps (of which two can be disabled) and two photos app (OnePlus Gallery and Google Photos app, which can't be uninstalled). Didn't find any bugs or functionality issue, no lags or stuttering. Apps open instantly and work fine. OxygenOS 11.3 with Feb 2022 security patch. I guess a stable Android 11 is better than a buggier Android 12 for most customers. But not sure what will happen from OxygenOS 12 which shares Oppo's ColorOS.- Some heating issue was there on a first day of use, but then got a system update and haven't noticed any heating afterwards.- Saw a rubber seal for the SIM tray, which could mean that there is some degree of water resistance, but there is no official IP rating. Also saw a YouTube video that tests the water resistance and the phone survived 15 min submersion in water. So there seems to be ""unofficial"" water resistance.- Cameras are okayish. Main cam takes good pictures at good lighting, but colors are a bit saturated. In wide angle camera, the exposure and color is less. Photos from selfie cam are a bit soft without any filters or modes. Haven't tested much low light or night photography.- Phone back panel is made of plastic, feels like plastic to touch but the blue color back panel looks really good. Good to hold in hand and use because of comparatively compact and thin size. A smaller bottom chin / bezel would have been better. The case provided is translucent and has a small pattern design (ie its not a plain).Overall it's a good phone to buy, you get some features like headphone jack and expandable memory which is good for people who have been using it from their previous phones.",  27 February 2022

¬†I am editing the review what I am facing in day to day task , using the phone since 3 months :Pros:1. Performance is superb, didn't feel any lag or bug yet.( ***Edition: YouTube unexpectedly closing 2-3 times repeatedly in 1 day , that may be bug which I faced recently)2. OS & Software: Got 2 security updates & 1 Android update ( Android 11 to 12 next day after purchasing the phone)3. Battery Charging : 40-45 min approx.4. Battery Drain: 1 day for moderate user ( WhatsApp, Insta, YouTube, Online Classes etc.)5. Gaming Performance: don't play any games so look some other's review.6. Camera: Superb in day light, descent in low light.7. Speaker: Single speaker is loud enough for your entertainment.8. Refresh Rate : for day to day task, 90 Hz r.r is smooth enough to perform.9. Special Features: Pocket Mode (No accidental impression on screen when phone is in your pocket), Expernal Storage ( Most of brand neglect this), 3.5 mm jack.Cons:1. Accidental screenshot is captured due to Volume button. It should be placed on slightly upper portion. You may the face the problem whenever you lock the screen.(***Edition: You can turn off that features for screenshot in setting)2. Camera should be improved in low light.3. It must be upgraded upto Android 14.4. You can't record any call otherwise it will inform the person that you are recording the voice.Pro Tips: 1. Use ""Ultra Steady Mode"" to take video for your content/personal memory.2. Select 'Standard Refresh Rate' for better battery output.I will edit my review later if I face an issue regarding daily usage.",  24 September 2022

¬†To give you a gist of the review, overall, the phone is 9.5/10.I'll talk about the specifics in this detailed review which shall give you the complete detailed aspect of the phone.1. DisplayThe display is quite vibrant. Brightness is great even in sunlight. Watching movies on netflix would be fun for you. Refresh rate of 90Hz works as a charm. Overall you won't find any issues with it.2. Processor & RamI have played quite decent games on it. Have run parallel apps at a single time. Couldn't find any lag in with this processor.3. BatteryYour phone charges from 20-100% in just 32 Mins. This 65 W charges is practically a blessing. I have screen time of around 6 hours. The battery lasts 24 hours very easily.4. CameraI don't use much of the camera but it is quite Okayish. Won't say excellent but will do the work.The front camera is quite good.5. Design & BodyThere is a little chin on the bottom of the phone which does not affect much to me but could have been improved. The back silver metallic finish bothers a lot as it shines like a mirror. Also, you will have small dots on the backpanel surface overtime. A cover can be used to minimise this effect. The only reason I reduced 0.5 in my rating is the back panel of the cellphone.6. Operating SystemLoved the operating System, pretty smooth, aesthetically pleasant, charm for your eyes.Overall this phone is a gem. You can always go for it.",16 September 2022

642,4,Overall okay but it can't beat camera quality of oppo,"Biggest mistake was to order at Amazon. I myself went at Amazon depot to receive it because delivery boy was not ready to come at 6 pm. Return is most complicated in Amazon. They fixed appointment with technician yesterday and there is no call till now. Flipkart is best to handle quality issues...Amazon broke my trust this time...it's okay for shopping upto 500/-.Camera quality is average. Battery is 4500 only but good thing is charging is very fast. Back cover provided by oneplus is white coloured which masks the appearance of mobile.Moreover, i will use it not more than 6 months due to Camera quality.....which is a little disappointing if you have used Oppo..",19 July 2022
643,5,A Pragmatic User's Take,"This is the best smartphone that I have ever owned. If you're someone like me, who wants to jump from the 10k range to a mid-range costing smartphone, I would suggest you go for it. My father and I bought the same phone model on the same day almost three months ago, both of us are not gamers or heavy users, but we prefer the smoothness of everyday workflow over everything else. So if you hate it when your phone takes an extended period of time to open up simple applications, you will love to upgrade to this. I had my apprehensions before buying because of the sceptical comments related to OnePlus dropping its quality, but frankly: I did not see a difference since I have never used a phone beyond the 20-25k price range. Spending more than this amount on a smartphone is just plain splurging in my opinion, especially for middle-class people like us.It does not have any apparent issues, if you take good care of it, I think it should probably last long.All in all, if you're looking for a no non-sense smartphone and think of a phone pragmatically and don't wish to delve into minute details, I would suggest going for this without any second thoughts.",22 September 2022

795,4,Not Good Not Bad,Mobile is like lottery you can get best and defective pieces. Camera suprised me i had seen many reviews degrading camera but for me it was good. Battery power charging is amazing in no time battery gets charged but battery life may not survive a day also. Hanging issue I have noticed after usage of 3 months and i don't play games. Feeling and look is good. Call recording other will be informed if you will be recording. Compass not available. VR feature also not available.,  26 July 2022

808,5,Mid ranger Flagship.,I got this mobile for ‚Çπ 16999 which was an awesome deal for me. I have rated this phone based on 5 rating points.Delivery- 5/5 was superfast and exchange took place with ease and got offer of extraa ‚Çπ3000 discount.Packaging- 5/5 Packaging was awesome by amazon and Oneplus packaging is clean and very good all the documents including Red Cable Membership card got 3 months extended warranty using this.Charging-5/5 65 watt charger is already provided in the box which phone supports very nice move not like other companies. Charging cable is of good quality and charger as well.Looks- 4.5/5 Aesthetic wise its premium with glass back and curved edges and metal frame. camera bump is not very much unusual and gives decent look to phone. Inbox provided cover is of very good quality and looks very good. It feels good to hold and not feel very bulky termed as slimmest oneplus phone. Lower chin is on big side could be a bit smaller.Connectivity-5/5 Total number of 5G band supported is 7 and the phone supports VOWIFI on both sim. It supports dual 5G which I feel is future proof. Bluetooth connectivity is awesome with earbuds. It also supports dual band wifi. Its has got triple slot.O.S-4/5 Only issues is that it runs on Android 11 out of the box but with latest android security update and future update promises. OS is very smooth no lags were found. Always on display is very good. Customization is top notch.Sensor-5/5 It has got all the sensors as required including step counter.Battery-5/5 Charging from 0-100 hardly takes time with in box charger. If AOD is on and little battery consumption is on higher side with 90hz screen. I feel its good with F-amoled display.Screen-5/5 Fell in love with it in display fingerprint scanner is very good and display is bright enough at this price point better than MI phones. Display is immersive. It supports HDR10+ and comes with corning gorilla glass 5.Camera-4/5 Back camera is good with natural light and though struggles in low light.Dark mode does a good job.4K video is supported at 30fps Selfie camera is good with lot of features. No OIS is provided in both the camera. But EIS present.Calling- Its very loud and clear and no issues found.Perfomance-5/5 taking pricing point into consideration its good mid ranger chipset works well with heavy games at medium setting and normal day to day operations are carried out without any lags.GB ram is enough for daily operation.My recommendation is that if you get this phone at ‚Çπ20K the its a very good deal without any single thought go for it. However if you are a gamer and want a phone below 20K then you can go for Infinix 5G. However If you want a good camera phone at same price point of this then go for Realme 9 PRO Plus without any thought as camera is excellent for still photos but you will have to compromise with display.,27 February 2022

So I researched about the phone and turns out this is the best budget friendly phone you can buy!! Absolutely stunning camera, Oxygen OS optimises the apps to perfectly that background apps don't drain your battery. It charges fast and you can just charge it 30mins in the morning before you leave for college or work and it'd be at 100% .

The good thing is you get one plus stickers and a plastic back cover with damage protection (the design of the back cover in a way that it protects your mobile glass from the damage the corners are edgy) so you don't need to buy it with extra cost.

Feels smooth and good on battery as well.Performance : Processor is doing more than good for day to day tasks. I don't play games so I can't comment on it.Battery : 4500MAH is decent power. It can last a day. 65W charger is amazing charges battery in 35 mins.Os : It's still clean Oxygen os on top of Color os. They should have given Android 12 out of the box.Camera : Missing OIS but not so many phone come in this price range with it. It clicks decent photos and videos in good lighting but struggles a lot in poor light conditions.Cons : I feel they should have provided stereo speakers, iconic alert slider, OIS in main camera and Android 12 out of box.",  29 March 2022

1655,4,A good phone to buy,"I have used it for more than a day and based on that, I am writing this review. The phone looks premium. I bought two of them and both the colours (Grey and Blue) are beautiful. It's a lightweight phone that gives a nice feel in hands. Comes with a transparent back cover that fits quite well. Camera quality is good but it should be improved with upcoming updates. I haven't checked 20x zoom yet. User interface is interesting but users like me need some time to become familiar with it. Charger definitely is faster than the supercars. It charges from 10 to 100 percent in 25-30 mins only without heating up. But the problem is the battery life. Without any high uses, it drained so fast. OnePlus must resolve this issue with upcoming updates. I am a moderate gamer and the phone doesn't hang at all, nor I experienced any heating issue. Touch is really smooth and the screen/display colours etc looks really wonderful (I am not a professional so can't write using professional jargons). Fingerprint sensor is fast enough and the animation associated with it looks beautiful. Overall it seems a nice phone to buy.May update the review after using it for a longer period.",  3 March 2022

1688,4,Affordable good quality.,"A big fan of 1+ phones n this is my fourth 1+ during last 6-7 years. Reason : Price competitive for the same specs of other Chinese competition makes. That brings the brand No. 2 in sales. But, definitely the brand's overall quality including battery is getting deteriorated since it has been started assembling in Vivo Noida plant.Now abt this product : Plastic type body doesn't give that bad impression, as often critics say. Other established brands in this range n specs r also have plastic body to make product lighter, though it adds to poor heat dissipation problem. U can't feel that unless u have ""never satisfied"" typo critic eyes.Call quality n internet performance is superb matching to processor specs. Can handle group video calls well in even weaker net. Picture quality is awesome with good color n in-depth reproduction. Heavier games make it hotter, but again that's the problem with every phone. Better remove phone cover while playing games.",  3 April 2022

1790,5,The most power packed performer in the below 20k range.,"Have been using this phone since the last one and half months and it's been going really fine although to say that I don't play any mobile games of any sort which is a kind of relief for any kind of phone.Although it's a rebranded version of Realme 9Pro Plus with mostly the same hardware and design but it's superior than the latter in most of the segment be it camera processing, display or processing power cause it has a refined software which is the OxygenOs and comes with a lot less bloatware than the latter.The only downgrade I felt in this phone is it's speaker which is a mono one and not the regular stereo one but it can get pretty loud but lacks smoothness and let me tell you the absence of a AMOLED screen is not a con cause although it lacks it but the blacks are blacker and it's relatively brighter even with a LCD panel and it gets pretty bright when outside or under the Sun otherwise all other components of the device works pretty well considering it's below 20k price tag.So, this was what I felt after using the device for one and half months.",  28 June 2022

1820,5,Great value phone for the price!,"I made the switch from my Samsung M51 to the Nord CE 2. I did a lot of research before settling on this phone. I read quite a lot of reviews as well. Here's my experience so far:1. I am not a gamer and do not use phones for gaming.2. I am not a photographer and am quite happy with simple photos. I don't care about contrast or saturation.3. I use my phone mainly for banking, messaging, browsing and calls.Switching from the Samsung M51, the Nord CE 2 feels a lot smoother. I can't tell much of a difference in the display between the two. The outdoor brightness for the phone is decent. There is no bloatware installed on the phone which is fantastic (Samsung needs to learn from this!). Sure, there is no Android 12 out of the box but I don't miss it since I've never used it and Android 11 is perfectly fine. The phone will receive the Android 12 update but it might take time (I'm in no hurry). The camera is fine for my needs. It comes with a headphone jack and a charger. Charging is fast -- I went from 50% to 100% in under 25 minutes. I also like that the phone is slightly smaller than the M51 and fits well in my hand and pocket. I've not experienced any overheating issues.Overall, for the price (I got a great deal since I exchanged my phone), it's a great phone. Some people are expecting too much from this phone but if your needs are simple like mine, this is an excellent device.",02 May 2022

1950,3,Recommended for Bug n spam free OS experience.,"Actually the rating is three and half stars. Since there's no provision for half star so I've rated it Three! Especially recommended to those who haven't experienced the OnePlus' Oxygen OS so far. For the uninitiated, Oxygen OS provides the bloatware-free OS. Closer to near stock Android.  No spammy notifications like Xiaomi or even Samsung nowadays. Mostly bug-free. The interface is neat.Battery is awesome. Easily lasts whole day with moderate to heavy usage.Camera is just above average.Display is great though it's LCD. Since it's LCD so obviously there's no in-screen fingerprint scanner. It's embedded with physical power button. So people looking for in-screen fingerprint scanner might feel disappointed.Sometimes screen remains dark and unresponsive despite ringing which can be resolved with new S/W patch provided OP deems it worthy to address. Obviously it can't be compared with it's more expensive cousins but overall a nice big phone and the best in this price range. Definitely worth a try, especially if you haven't used Oxygen. For the rest, be adventurous, try something new if you can, otherwise it's always a safe bet.",  24 June 2022

Got two security patch updates too in a week which is really a great thing.The camera is really good. The phone looks premium and is lightweight and slim. It feels good in hand.Even though the speaker is mono firing speaker and not stereo speakers, it really is very loud. The screen is beautiful and there's Gorilla Glass 5 protection on the front and back.Now, coming to the battery, it easily lasts a whole day and it charges real quick and you're ready to use it whole day (100% battery)after just 35-40 mins of charge.I do casual gaming (BGMI and COD) and I didn't find any lag or jitter.

2051,5,Great pick for semi mid range. Amazon's exchange service is ridiculous.,"I bought this phone during the Monsoon carnival. My budget was around 20k and I wanted to try OnePlus for the first time. After 20 days of usage, I feel the phone is genuinely good to use. The Screen Refresh rate is 120hz, pretty smooth and quick. Camera is decent as well, not the best of course but does the job tbh. Rest all features are good and one won't be dissatisfied. I'm super angry with Amazon's exchange service. I had requested an exchange for my old samsung device. I had an 4400 off the purchase price. But the delivery agent rejected the phone exchange. Phone is still working fine, it just had some scratch on the back due to wear and tear which is normal. But it was rejected and I had to pay the difference. Worst exchange service ever.

2078,5,Absolutely Fantastic Phone,"Here are some important points that I noticed about the smartphone :1. Best Operating system after iPhone so you and ur data is safe. Those who do all their banking transactions through mobile, understand it's need. Plus 3 years security update. That's really great thing.2. Camera is good enough. Sharp and zoom is really good.3. AMOLED display is amazing. Difference noticed while watching movies on Amazon Prime, Netflix etc. It's super.4. No DTS however phone sound is quite loud. Can take calls on loudspeaker without any issue.5. No complaint in speed. I don't play games however tried and it did not disappoint me.6. No heating issue. Heats little bit while charging and it's obvious as it's 120 W, I believe. Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 years warranty. Seems like company is pretty sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that. Rest are not so important for me however phone did well on all areas.I am thankful to the seller for providing me the phone in best condition and I thank Amazon for free and fast delivery.",  16 June 2022

2186,3,Its very delicate!!,"I have no point of comparison except for my older oppo A83(2018) model. Thats an older model and yet very much better than the new ONE PLUS.  I should have gone for an Oppo newer model as replacement but wanted to try this.15 days after my purchase,  the phone fell down from a high table, maybe about 4-4.5 feet high and the screen broke.Now I have to shell another 8k to get it replaced. While at store, I met three other people who had come for screen replacement too as theirs also broke.  One guy was coming to get it replaced 2nd time.If you do however plan to purchase the phone,  go for a wallet style cover, because I dont think this phone can take any other type of case.My phone was in an open case provided by ONE PLUS and screen was covered with gorilla glass.My oppo falls down on an average 2-3 times a day,  and have had no issues in the past 3 years.... Except for the fact that the memory has become too less for me to accomodate all the apps,  I would have stuck to my oppo.Overall for a brand like ONE PLUS,  I expected better.üòû DISAPPOINTED!!!PROS : The fast charger is really awesome.  30 mins charges it to full. Thats the only feature I love about it.",13 April 2022

2375,5,"performance and value under Rs 20,000. But is OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G worth the money","The 6.59-inch LCD display comes with 1080√ó2412 pixels and 401 PPI pixel density. The phone offers a 20:9 aspect ratio and a 120Hz refresh rate. OnePlus has tried to balance it out with support for a 120Hz refresh rate display. But that doesn‚Äôt take the focus away from the display being dull from some of the rivals in the segment. Coming back to the display performance, the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G offers smooth animations, all thanks to the higher refresh rate. Mind you that the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G packs a higher refresh rate than what we get on the OnePlus Nord CE 2, which is a bit costly.We had a good time using the OnePlus Nord CE 2 Lite 5G display as it supported HD content on popular OTT apps like Netflix and Amazon Prime. The panel is bright and offers swift colours. Though, we have to admit that it missed the punchiness of an AMOLED panel.Overall, it strikes a balance of an inferior panel and a fast refresh rate which should work well for most users in this price segment.",17 May 2022

Camera also average not like anyone can expect from a OnePlus phone.Indisplay fingerprint and face lock are not fast as other brand phones.Charging is fast, but if you use a little bit while charging the speed will reduce automatically to 50watts. Only charging while phone switched off will give you proper speed.I have attached one screenshot, see in that screenshot it is showing in notification that charging is complete but in the top battery indicator it is showing 82%. Like this many other bugs are there. Hope OnePlus will eliminate all such bugs in next update as it comes with a old Android version 11 and latest is Android 12. It's just one weeks of usage and there's a lot of issues don't know where to report.Thanks for reading. This is my honest review on this device.",  29 April 2022

I'm not much of a phone user, except calls and messaging sometimes. And maybe stream some media and spotify mostly. But on average I register about 3-4 hours of use daily, so the battery life lasts me about a day and a half. Plus this is my first fast charging experience, so I'm happy with that. about 30 mins from 20% to a 100%. Not bad at all. Camera is good too. I won't use it much, but it's a nice feature regardless. everything works quite smooth and overall, a decent phone and quite sturdy too. Build quality is pretty damn good. My only gripe was the delivery. My first order apparently got misplaced by the incompetency of the delivery team. It roamed in my city for 4 days, and after a heated call with customer service, it was replaced with a new order immediately after. So no harm no foul!  Overall I'd give it 4.5 stars. It gets the job done fast, and comes with a boatload of features too.",06 April 2022

Charges mobile to 40% in just 10-15 minutes...7. 2 yes warranty. Seems like company is preety sure, it won't brake down.Conclusion: at this cost getting best OS and happy with that.

2893,5,Best budget phone at this price!!!!,"This review is after 3 weeks of use of Oneplus nord ce2 5g (8gb 128gb)1. Pros- Display is good and gets quite bright in outdoors due to its claimed 800 nits brightness.- Supports upto 8 5G bands. Has wifi 6, bluetooth 5.2, nfc, dual 4G sims with expandable storage.- Mediatek dimensity 900 by no means is an efficienct chip and is a power hogger. But it packs a punch for day to day use. No lag and stutters. Snapdragon SOC fans might want to avoid this phone- Calls are clear and loud. Stereo speaker is single and is decent.- Screen refresh rate of 90hz is sufficient and the general use at 90hz feels smooth and fluid.- Under display fingerpriny reader is accurate and never misreads.2. Cons- Camera is decent and requires daylight to take crisp and crystal clear photos.- Battery life is 1 day for heavy users and is 2 days for light users. I got 8hrs of SOT with medium to heavy use. Mind that it was always on 90hz mode.Overall package is good and i'm totally satisfied with it.",  14 March 2022

I am not so camera enthusiastic, gaming and chatting person and needed some good phone within my budget meeting my basic expecations like good battery backup, latest Android OS, touch, UI, screen size, weight, call recording options etc..And I have heard lot of good impressions on the OnePlus phones from past.But I am very disappointed by ordering this item as it had some heating issues. The phone heats so fast while charging and using it for continoisly 15-20 mins. I had to return this item after calling customer care and inspecting the phone by installing mInspect app as they found some problem with charging. If you are fine with heating issues then go ahead buying this product .As I am not so camera enthusiastic person I could not judge much on the camera front. But could take some decent pictures with good image clarity. Also could not check much on the battery as it had heating issues.But touch sensitivity is all good and a good phone which meets your basic expectation within 25k.One plus could have given more focus on resolving the heating issues for this type of flagship phone. And its light weight phone (173 gm) which is easy to carry and handle. Screen size (6.43 inches) is also standard which is enough for viewing videos and chatting. Overall if you are fine with heating issues then its a good option within 25k budget.",  28 May 2022

About 20 minutes, the battery is completely charged. Look and feel of the phone is nice. OnePlus phones are always charged at a premium price, but I feel the cost can be reduced.",  26 May 2022

Also, this model has some issue with the proximity sensor. One of cousins and I had purchased this phone during the launch offer. But both of us have the same issue with proximity sensor. Even if we lock the phone while in a call, the display turns on automatically with every small movement and will start dialling on it own which will make the listener uncomfortable (listening to the continuous tap on keys). Other than these two, I have not noticed any other issue. But I feel its not a model worthy of 20K",  26 August 2022

Also the night charging is great the phone automatically optimises how fast to charge the mobile so that it reaches 100% at 6 in the morning.Happy till now with the purchase.Though there is a downside I hated the google phone and contact app I am badly missing the stock OnePlus apps, this is OnePlus not some android phone please don't use third party apps just be yourself you are gr8.",  26 February 2022

3915,2,Not a value for money item,"Was having high expectations while buying. I own a Samsung S20 FE 5G and this OnePlus Nord CE2 was bought as a gift for mom. I should say that I was disappointed. There is a slight lag issue(many already reported, which I ignored while buying).Another thing I noticed is that, the call recording feature is hectic. Like the new phones, it starts the recording after the voice warning. But my S20 FE doesn't warn like this.Another thing is, the auto call recording can be enabled for all non-saved numbers, but for contacts saved in your phone, you would have to manually add them one by one to the list so that auto-recording would happen. That's the most stupid thing. Because most of us would have 1000s of contacts. And adding them one by one to the list for auto-call recording is a tedious task.Another issue is, the camera is way too below average. Expected a better camera from this phone.And I initially noticed some heating issue on the screen side.One advantage is that, the weight is less. So carrying it or using it with your hands won't be a headache.",  20 June 2022

I tried to re-start, but still same problem. On 2nd day, three vertical lines appeared. I had spoken with Amazon customer care and they told me that ticket has been raised and engineer will visit in 7 working days and will submit the feedback. After that only Amazon will confirm the replacement.I have gone through on Google and many people were facing such type of issues with OnePlus. First time I tried to experience One plus product in my life, but sorry to say this is very disappointing. I have been associated with Amazon since quite long and done ""N""  nos. of transaction, however never faced any issues while returning the defective product, but here I received very disappointing response from Amazon customer care. This is manufacturing defect and OnePlus & Amazon should stop distribution of such kind of handsets and replace the faulty one immediately. I am escalating to Amazon owner, let's see, if get any support, else will go to consumers court.",04 October 2022

4956,2,Not expected this from an oneplus phone,"As a tech geek these are my experiences with this phone..1.Fingerprint scan is not smooth as compare to other low end phone also2. Due to omnivison camera, picture quality is not good in low light.. Okayish camera3. No inbuilt app for messages, dialer, recorder, notes.. All are google based apps4. MAJOR problem- It has google CALL RECORDER by default.. If you record during call ""it will prompt recording has started"" which can be heard to both caller and receiver.. I mean people use Call recorder for safety and secure purpose, but here it is opposite5. If you turn on WiFi hotspot for more than 10 15 minutes,it will start showing heating issue6. After software update, for twice my audio was not working, had to restart again7. Battery drains fast in ambient display mode..8. Did not find any difference in power saving mode aa compare to normal mode.. Battery drains in same speed in both mode..9. I mean its 2022, then why android 11?10..No stereo speakerFew pros :-Look wise its best.. Display is top notch.. Better than Oneplus CE.. 12bands 5g support.. comes with nfc..Few other issues are also there..",09 March 2022
